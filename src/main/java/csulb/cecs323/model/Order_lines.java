This is the junction table between Orders and Products.  We would
normally use the @ManyToMany mapping if we did not have the
additional columns of quantity and unit_sale_price to contend
with.  In that case, we could have let JPA generate the junction
table for us and left it at that.  As it is, however, we have
to build it ourselves.

One question that I have is if we had a model in which the
association class was the parent to some other class, would
that mean that you would have to explicitly declare the
association class the way that we are doing here.  It seems to
me that would be the case.
